# ...but DO commit the sports list used by Actions
!data/sports.json

# (optional) keep a readme or placeholder if you want the folder tracked
!data/README.md
!data/.gitkeep

# Keep all odds dumps ignored (large, noisy)
data/odds/

# Debug artefacts from parsing
debug/

# Allow reports to be committed (probabilities, summaries, bets)
# (Do NOT ignore reports/; the workflows write reports here)
